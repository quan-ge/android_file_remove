# Automatic Folder Cleanup

The latest update adds functionality to remove the crap generated by macOS.

Folders will be moved to the "$android_file" directory.

### Description

Use this tool to clean up useless folders automatically created by Android (and macOS) in your USB drive.

If you find any folders missed by the script, please let me know via "GitHub Issues"!

### Usage

Download the "Android Folder Cleanup.bat" file to the root directory of your USB drive.

Important!

It must be placed in the root directory!

Then, double-click to run it.

(The script is only available on Windows.)
